PDFs are a fine thing. But sometimes we want to edit them. Mostly for
printing.

## Pdfjam

This command-line tool named  [pdfjam](http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/PDFjam)
uses latex to edit PDFs. It should be available in the repositories of
most Linux distros. There are also
[useful examples](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/software/pdfjam/).

*You can offset* pages of a (twosided) document in order to make room for a binding, etc.:

    pdfjam --twoside myfile.pdf --offset '1cm 0cm' --suffix 'offset'

This doesn't scale, it just shifts the content.

*You can even* use pdfjam to produce PDFs with two pages per page:

    pdfjam myfile.pdf --trim '1cm 2cm 1cm 2cm' --clip true --outfile /dev/stdout | \
    pdfjam --nup 2x1 --landscape --frame true --outfile myoutput.pdf

This cuts the four sides of the document and puts two sides on one.

## Getting rid of Margins

If you want to print large documents two-sided, large margins will
produce small text.

### Pdfcrop

On Linux (Ubuntu) there is a nice command line tool called
[pdfcrop](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/gutsy/man1/pdfcrop.1.html).
Several examples are given
[here](http://askubuntu.com/questions/124692/command-line-tool-to-crop-pdf-files).

It removes all white margins of pdfs:

    pdfcrop --margins '5 10 20 30' input.pdf output.pdf

Without the `--margins` flag, pdfcrop would produce zero margins, which
might look awkward.

### Pdfscissors

There is also a nice Java tool with a GUI:
[pdfscissors](https://sites.google.com/site/pdfscissors/). It shows you
all pages of a document half-transparent stacked so that you can select
what to cut on all pages simultaneously.



## Pdftk

There is also the capable command-line tool called
[pdftk](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/pdftk).
