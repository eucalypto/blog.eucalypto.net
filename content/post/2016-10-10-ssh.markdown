## Run ssh-agent in remote login

When you log into a machine with SSH and want to use a SSH key to do further
stuff, like managing a remote git repository, you may have to

{{< highlight bash >}}
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_ssh_id
{{< / highlight >}}

according to
[this site]. Then the shell remembers your SSH key as long as it is open.
