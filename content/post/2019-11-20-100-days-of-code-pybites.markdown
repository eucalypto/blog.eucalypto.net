title: So, I've started the 100 days of code challenge with PyBites

So, I've started the 100 days of code challenge with PyBites. I really enjoy doing PyBites and this challenge is a nice push towards doing it regularly.

You can see my progress here: https://codechalleng.es/100days/eucalypto/4862

Right now I'm at day 27. Which is quite impressive for me but if you are reading this in the future, you can see if I managed to keep up until the 100 days!

This is also a good reason to use Twitter! I'm posting there each day to have some kind of open record.
