Over the last several years I've not updated my blog because I starded using [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/). Its capable list creation and navigation made it feel natural to organize my thoughts and knowledge in a deep tree structure. This blog overlaps with this use-case because I started it to take notes for my future self.

Now I'm re-activating this blog to show the world what I'm up to. To give back at least some knowledge and insight that I gained by reading the wonderful blogs and tutorials of today.
