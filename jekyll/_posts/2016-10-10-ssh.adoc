== Run ssh-agent in remote login

When you log into a machine with SSH and want to use a SSH key to do further
stuff, like managing a remote git repository, you may have to

[source, bash]
----
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/your_ssh_id
----

according to
http://serverfault.com/questions/672346/straight-forward-way-to-run-ssh-agent-and-ssh-add-on-login-via-ssh[this
site]. Then the shell remembers your SSH key as long as it is open.
